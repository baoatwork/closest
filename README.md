## Introduction
Sumner is a wealthy friend of yours, and tomorrow is his birthday. Sumner has invited you to join his five-day-long birthday party at his suburban mansion. Now you are at the mansion's gate, and everything here seems tranquil and beautiful. However, what you don't know is, that a bizarre journey is about to unfold...

## Project Statement
Creators: Zihan Feng & Zixin Wang

Skeleton in the Closest is a web-based game developed as the final coursework for the Communications Lab at New York University Shanghai (2017). We were inspired by the tabletop game Werewolf Kill and wanted to recreate a similar gaming experience in Skeleton in the Closest. This game features multiple endings and diverse choice paths, so only with careful investigation and reasoning can the player survive in the dangerous mansion.

Also, we want to express our sincere thanks to our friends who participated in the filming of the game's visual assets.
